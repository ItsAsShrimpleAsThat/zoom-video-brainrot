If the given line of speech from a video is actively giving instructions, directions, or doing anything else where a user may want to see the accompanying video (ex. doing an example problem, giving a live coding demo, or if a guest speaker is speaking), say "INSTRUCTION." Otherwise, list 1-4 keywords from the speech. The keywords must be terms of high notability that would be easy to find an image for.

Images of those keywords will be displayed on screen instead of the video. Only make a list of keywords, do not output anything else. Do not start with "keywords:" or anything openers that. Only output the words
