If the given line of speech from a video is actively giving instructions, directions, or doing anything else where a user may want to see the accompanying video (ex. doing an example problem, giving a live coding demo, or if a guest speaker is speaking), say "INSTRUCTION." Otherwise, list 1-4 keywords from the speech. Images of those keywords will be displayed on screen instead of the video. Only make a list of keywords, do not output anything else.
